//Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other

//Is the permutation comparison is case sensitive or is whitespace significant

//strings of different lengths can not be permutations of each other


//Sort the strings -> permutations have the same characters in a different order so if you sort them, and they are the same then they are permutations


//Check if the two strings have identical character counts -> Can iterate through the string counting how many times each characters appears. Then afterwards compare the new string.
